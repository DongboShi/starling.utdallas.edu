The course aims to bring three different interesting research directions inside AI/ML that have recently caught the imagination of the researchers: Reinforcement Learning, Human-in-the-loop Learning, and Fairness in learning models. We will read papers in these directions. The end goal is to be able to implement existing baselines and potentially new algorithms in these problems.
